## Q1: Multiples of 3 and 5

Find the sum of all positive multiples of 3 or 5 below a specified number (`limit`).

```javascript
function multiples(limit) {
  // ...
}
```

Example Tests:

```javascript
multiples(1)    // 0
multiples(10)   // 23
multiples(16)   // 60
```

### Hint

Numbers that are both multiples of 3 and 5 should only be counted once. For example, **15** should only be counted as once.

Note that `limit` is **non-inclusive**, so if the limit was `15`, the list of numbers we would be interested in are `[3, 5, 6, 9]`.
